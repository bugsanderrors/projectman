I know we are taking it slowly and steadily, and ofcourse I know you are not sure of us now and maybe you choose to be not together later (which I wish never happen). So I wanted to express my love while I can and will continue to do so if everything turns right. People say love is not enough to sustain a relationship that there are certain other things, which I agree to...there should be some compatability between two people, but I also believe love is a major part of it and if two person gave their one hundred percent, everything is possible. I am all 100% for you, can't even tell you how much you mean being here in my life. I want to be with you till the very end, in both happy and sad phases of life, to take care of each other. I know sirf bolne mein acchi lagti hai ye sab baatein but I will make sure you feel safe, loved and at home." textAlign="Begin" class="sapUiSmallMarginBottom"/>
